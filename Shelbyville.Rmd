This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 


```{r}
calculate_annual_growth <- function(year_one,year_two,pop_y1, pop_y2,city) {
  annual_growth <- (((pop_y2 - pop_y1) / pop_y1) * 100) / (year_two-year_one)
  message <- paste("From", year_one, "to", year_two, "the population of", city, "grew by approximately", annual_growth, "% each year.")
  print(message)
  return(annual_growth)
}

city_name <- "Shelbyville, Ky"
# earliest population
# 1990
population_one <- 6449
# recent population
# 2021
population_two <- 17379

population_change <- population_two - population_one
print(population_change)

# Calculate percentage growth
percentage_gr <- (((population_two - population_one)/ population_one) * 100)


#Calculate annual growth
annual_gr <- percentage_gr/31

calculate_annual_growth(1990, 2021, population_one, population_two, city_name)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
